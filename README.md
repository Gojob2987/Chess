## todo:
### part 0
- [x] create branch for assignment1.2
- [x] refactor(code smell elimination)
- [x] more documentation
- [x] extract individual Piece into another package
- [x] coordinate class (tried and didnt work, trade off not worth)

### part 1
- [x] game loop (not easy to write unit test cases though, much of it is ActionListener that needs to be tested with UI)

### part 2
- [x] GUI (MVC)

### part 3
- [x] moveBack()
- [x] undo (could have done better using maybe Command Pattern, right now it's rather messy)


### part 4
- [x] test plan
